The code : "functions.cpp" contains all the functions required for running the other codes. 

Firstly, run "analyze.cpp" to analyze the encoding in the given assignment.

Then, run "inp-outp-gen.cpp" to generate desired inputs and their corresponding outputs as 
mentioned in the analysis.

Then, run "diag-elem.cpp" to get the possible sets (A_ii, E_i) as mentioned in analysis.

After that, finallyt run "A-E-Password-finder.cpp" to generate the matrix A, the vector E 
and our password (with extra zeroes) as outputs, respectively.
